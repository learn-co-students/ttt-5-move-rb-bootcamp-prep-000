#1. Our program should first welcome the player by outputting a friendly message to the terminal: "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!".
puts "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"
#2. Next, establish the starting state of the game, i.e. the empty board. Create a new board by setting a variable `board` equal to instantiating a new array with 9 elements, each of which is a blank space, `" "`.
board = [" "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "]
#3. Now, ask the user for input by outputting "Where would you like to go?" to the terminal.
puts "Where would you like to go?"
#4. We need to store the user's input. Use `gets.strip` to store their input to a variable, `input`.
input = gets.strip
#5. Now we want to convert the user's input to an array index using our `#input_to_index` method and store this as the variable `index`.
index = input_to_index(input)
#6. Now we're ready to call our `#move` method. Do so with the arguments of the `board`, the `index` the user wants to access and the default player of `"X"`.
move(board, index, character="X")
#7. Lastly, display the board by calling the `#display_board` method, passing in the necessary arguments required to run this method.
display_board(board,)
